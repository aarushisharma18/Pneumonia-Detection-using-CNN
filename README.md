# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN
## Neural Networks and Deep Learning



### Introduction: 
Pneumonia is a critical global health concern, demanding early and accurate detection for effective treatment. This project introduces a novel method for pneumonia detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging CNNs, the model has been trained on a substantial dataset of chest X-ray images and evaluated on a separate test set. The goal is to improve accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening lung infection affecting millions annually.



### Model Objective:
The primary objective is to develop an automated pneumonia detection system using CNNs. The model is designed to analyze chest X-ray images, discerning the presence of pneumonia with high accuracy. Early diagnosis is paramount for timely intervention and prevention of complications. The CNN-based approach provides a promising solution to enhance pneumonia detection, aiding healthcare professionals in their decision-making process.



### Dataset Description:
The dataset consisted of a total of **5863 Chest X-ray images** belonging to **2 classes** - **Pneumonia / Normal**. 
1. **Train Dataset** - 5216 Images
2. **Test Dataset** - 624 Images
3. **Validation Dataset** - 16 Images


### Challenges Addressed:
The project addresses several key challenges in pneumonia detection:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of chest X-ray images with clear labels for both normal and pneumonia cases.
2. **Data Pre-processing**: Standardizing image sizes, pixel normalization, and data augmentation to prepare the dataset for training.
3. **Model Building**: Designing an effective CNN architecture that can learn and extract relevant features from X-ray images.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing robust evaluation metrics to accurately assess the model's performance.
5. **Continued Advancements**: Acknowledging the evolving field of CNNs in medical imaging and anticipating further developments in pneumonia detection.
